description : |
    <p>This app allows a user to extract a set of genomes from a user-generated species Tree object. First, it copies the set of genomes from the tree to the current Narrative.
    The output widget lets you name the Genome Set object and select specific genomes from the genomes contained in the input Tree object.
    The genomes can be deleted from the output set by clicking the trashcan icon. Additional genomes can be added by pressing the &quot;Add&quot; button at the bottom of the table in the Narrative panel.
    The Genome Set object is saved when the &quot;Save&quot; button is clicked. The resulting Genome Set object can then be used as input to other apps such as <a data-method-id=Òcompute_pangenomeÓ>Compute Pangenome</a> and <a data-method-id=Òinsert_genomeset_into_species_tree_genericÓ>Insert Set of Genomes into Species Tree</a>.</p>
    <p>Note: when inserting one or more genomes into a species tree, the inserted genomes that are also contained within the KBase list of species will be duplicated in the tree. One copy will have the KBase list ID and the other will have the ID of the inserted genome. The genomes will also be duplicated in any genome set generated from the tree.</p>
